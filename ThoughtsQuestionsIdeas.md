## thoughts, questions and ideas

What are the conditions for a **safe deposit box** (costs, what can I define in terms of who can access it besides me in which case) and where to rent one?

Just putting a **piece of paper** somewhere with all passwords... but what about accounts with two factor authentication? Access to the associated mobile phone number needs to be ensured. Or backup pins written on that paper?

**Encrypt a text file** with login credentials, give the private key to a notary? 

Use your actively used or a specially dedicated **password manager** to keep credentials up to date and only put the master password somewhere safe? Put that password manager file onto a USB-stick or a Dropbox folder that is accessible with a link you share?

Hide keys behind **riddles** that only those can solve that are meant to solve it?

Share only access to your main email account because the **forgot password** function can be used on all other accounts? How are credentials reset on a two factor authentication account?

What is the **legal situation** on that matter? Under which conditions to companies have to open accounts of deceased persons? Who owns the data? ...
