# E-Postmortem

Many have heard about or experienced the struggles regarding the *digital legacy* of a suddenly deceased person: how to get to important data on a locked computer, how to avoid clueless people posting birthday greetings on the facebook profile of the deceased, how to stop paid subscriptions without knowing the login credentials for the account etc.?

This repository is intended as a place to collect ideas how to deal with these things (legally and practically) in an unprepared case but especially how to prepare for such an unwanted event in your own case. Besides ideas also usecases will be collected where people share (anonymously if they want) their E-Postmortem setups that are already in place or share their stories how they dealt with unprepared cases. The idea is also to put some ideas into code, test little tools and maybe eventually build something that can be put to meaningful use out there. At the moment I am thinking about an assistant that walks you through the steps for your E-Postmortem setup. The definition of *when am I dead* (e.g. 1 month of inactivity on your computer) has first to be set and then what to do, ranging from *wipe everything clean and delete all accounts* to *upload all my unfinished work to a public repository*. Trusted people can be set that should gain access to defined sets of data and online accounts...

##What already exists
- **Google** provides an [Inactive Account Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive) that allows one to define people who get access to this account after a minimum of three months of inactivity. A personal message can be attached.
- **Facebook** has the option for [Memorialized Accounts](https://www.facebook.com/help/103897939701143). To request turning an account of a deceased person into a memorialized one, proof of death has to be submitted.
