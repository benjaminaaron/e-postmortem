## active E-Postmortem setups
If you have some sort of active setup in place for yourself, feel warmly invited to share it here as inspiration for others. If you want to stay anonymous, send it to me and I add it without your name. And of course do "blur" the parts that are "mission critical" as much as you wish to still have a good feeling about the safety of your setup.
